Explanation:
This query aims to find the top 5 customers who have paid the highest total amounts to Rockbuster from the top 10 cities (based on customer count) in the top 10 countries. The query performs the following steps:
1)Join Tables: The query starts by joining the necessary tables (payment, customer, address, city, and country) to access all required fields.
2)Filter by Top Cities: The subquery in the WHERE clause filters the cities to the top 10 cities within the top 10 countries based on the number of customers.
3)Calculate Total Payment: The total amount paid by each customer is summed up for each of these top cities.
4)Order and Limit: In descending order, the results are ordered by total_amount_paid, and the top 5 customers are selected.
